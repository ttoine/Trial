This tutorial shows how to use the web REST API provided by Bonita BPM 6 in order to create new accounts in Python. You need to have a working Bonita BPM 6 to test the code below. This can be done with Bonita BPM Studio after deploying Bonita BPM Portal. This example is run on a Linux distribution (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).
